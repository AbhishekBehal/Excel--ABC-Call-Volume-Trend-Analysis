ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis

Average Call Duration: Determine the average duration of all incoming calls received by agents. This should be calculated for each time bucket.
Approach: What is the average duration of calls for each time bucket?

Call Volume Analysis: Visualize the total number of calls received. This should be represented as a graph or chart showing the number of calls against time. Time should be represented in buckets (e.g., 1-2, 2-3, etc.).
Approach: Can you create a chart or graph that shows the number of calls received in each time bucket?

Manpower Planning: The current rate of abandoned calls is approximately 30%. Propose a plan for manpower allocation during each time bucket (from 9 am to 9 pm) to reduce the abandon rate to 10%. In other words, you need to calculate the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket to ensure that at least 90 out of 100 calls are answered.
Approach: What is the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket to reduce the abandon rate to 10%?

Night Shift Manpower Planning: Customers also call ABC Insurance Company at night but don't get an answer because there are no agents available. This creates a poor customer experience. Assume that for every 100 calls that customers make between 9 am and 9 pm, they also make 30 calls at night between 9 pm and 9 am. The distribution of these 30 calls is as follows:
Approach: Propose a manpower plan for each time bucket throughout the day, keeping the maximum abandon rate at 10%.

Assumptions: An agent works for 6 days a week; On average, each agent takes 4 unplanned leaves per month; An agent's total working hours are 9 hours, out of which 1.5 hours are spent on lunch and snacks in the office. On average, an agent spends 60% of their total actual working hours (i.e., 60% of 7.5 hours) on calls with customers/users. The total number of days in a month is 30.





Conclusion & Recommendations
•	Peak hours require higher agent allocation to meet demand.
•	Night shift staffing is essential to improve service quality.
•	Bar chart visualization helps identify call trends for better planning.
•	Optimizing workforce allocation reduces abandoned calls and enhances efficiency.
